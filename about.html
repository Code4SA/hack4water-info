Five provinces, North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the Free State, have already been declared disaster areas, with food security threatened as affected farms are unable to harvest crops or feed their livestock. It is also forecast that food prices will suffer a significant increase should the drought continue.</p>
